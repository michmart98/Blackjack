# BlackJack Game implemented in Python
This is the second Milestone Project for Udemy Course: 2022 Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python by Jose Portilla Head of Data Science at Pierian Training
It is a BlackJack Game implemented in Python, the player has as opponent the "machine". 
## Code
The code is mostly based in the course, with some improvements regarding functioning and preventing errors
## Play
• At the begining, we initialize the chips that the player has and how many of them he wants to bet for this game. <br />
• Each player starts with 2 Cards in their hand.  <br />
• The player has two options: Hit (draw a card) or Stand (stay with your currrent cards). <br />
• If the player has over 21, he is busted and the game is over, the same for the "computer". <br />
• If both players' sum is under 21, then we compare them, the greater wins. <br />
• When the game is over, we ask the player if he wants to replay. <br />
• In addition, we ask if he wants to increase his chips or not. <br />
